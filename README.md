# Nutrition and Health Tracking Excel Tool üìäüçï

Greetings everyone! üëã I'm excited to share my first project. I‚Äôve been immersed in developing a comprehensive nutrition and health tracking tool for my ‚ÄúPortfolio‚Äù project using Excel. Here‚Äôs a breakdown in a more polished manner
# 1.	Data Source:
‚Ä¢	Acquired an extensive USDA Food Data Central dataset via their API (https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/).
# 2.	API Integration:
‚Ä¢	Employed Python to integrate the API, facilitating the extraction and incorporation of food data into Excel.
# 3.	Data Organization and Excel Refinement:
‚Ä¢	I have implemented Excel functions, such as XLOOKUP, INDIRECT, Conditional Formatting, and more, to organize and manipulate the food dataset efficiently. Simultaneously, I conducted meticulous data cleaning, eliminating duplicates to enhance the Excel files' overall structure and user experience. This dual approach ensures a streamlined and user-friendly interface for effective data management.
# 4.	User-Customized Foods:
‚Ä¢	Introduced a dedicated section enabling users to add their food items, ensuring adaptability to individual preferences.

# 7.	Meal Planning:
‚Ä¢	 Created a sophisticated ‚ÄúWEEKLY MEAL PLAN‚Äù sheet, empowering users to select and quantify foods with real-time nutritional insights through bar and pie graphs.

# 9.	Interactive Functionality:
‚Ä¢	Implemented VBA scripts for user-friendly buttons, enhancing the tool‚Äôs functionality. Utilized Excel functions for real-time data manipulation and visualization.
# Important Notes
‚Ä¢	This tool is an educational project; it does not provide official dietary guidelines. BMI and BMR formulas adhere to the standards the World Health Organization and Harris-Benedict set, respectively.

‚Ä¢	As a management information systems Bachelor student and self-learner, this project reflects my knowledge of data analysis and Excel proficiency. For personalized health advice, consult with healthcare professionals.

‚Ä¢	It‚Äôs my first project. I‚Äôm enthusiastic about expanding my skills and refining this tool further. If you have any suggestions, questions, or ideas related to data analysis, I‚Äôm all ears! Your input is invaluable, and I‚Äôm open to incorporating new features or functionalities to enhance the overall user experience. Feel free to reach out with your feedback!
